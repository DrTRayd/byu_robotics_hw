According to the trials I ran on this method it seemed to work unless the obstacle was placed inside of a link at the arm's original orientation. 
The general approach was to use potential fields to drive the arm towards the goal, the way I used that here is that the end effector is being 
attracted towards the end goal, however there are repulsive forces that are applied to both joint 4 and the end effector when they get too close to the obstacle. 
This does cause issues if the end goal is too close to the obstacle, as the two competing forces causes the arm to stall before it reaches the goal.
